# SORTIFY
Sortify is an advanced waste management system integrating IoT and AI for efficient sorting and recycling. It uses a YOLOv8s model for real-time waste classification, a Flutter Flow app for user interaction, and a Raspberry Pi 4 with various sensors and motors. This project aims to enhance recycling and sustainability.

Implementation Details:

-AI Implementation: Utilizes the YOLOv8s model for real-time waste classification. The dataset includes 1,400 images per category, with training conducted on a Kaggle notebook. The model achieved 95% accuracy.

-Hardware Components: Features a Raspberry Pi 4, servo motors, DC motors, an L298N motor driver, IR sensors, a PCA9685 servo driver, and more for precise waste sorting.

-Application Features: Built with Flutter Flow and Firebase, the app includes user registration, real-time feedback, a points system, and admin controls.

-Installation and Usage Instructions: Follow the setup guide in the repository to configure the hardware, deploy the AI model, and run the mobile application. Detailed steps and configurations are provided.
